            <p>Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Pikachu) is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.</p>
            <p>It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a
                Thunder Stone.</p>
            <p> In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.</p>
            <p>Pikachu has a Gigantamax form. Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.</p>
            <p> In Pokémon Yellow, the starter Pikachu will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved
                on another save file. In Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!, the player's starter Pikachu also will not evolve,
                but cannot be traded to become a Raichu.</p>
            <p>Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and one of Nintendo's major mascots.
            </p>
            <p>It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu!. It has made
                numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.</p>
            <p>Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes
                            on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a
                            red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on
                            each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of
                            brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a
                            heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs.</p>
            
            
                        <p>The anime has shown that wild Pikachu live in groups in forested areas. Pikachu communicate amongst
                            themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In the anime, Alolan Pikachu are known
                            to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to
                            receive and send messages with each other, as well as other Electric Pokémon species. It raises its tail
                            to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow,
                            they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with
                            electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches
                            of burnt grass. It has been observed eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other
                            electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it
                            looks for ways to escape from the latter.</p>
            
                        <p>Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It is
                            able to release electric discharges of varying intensity. Pikachu has been known to build up energy in
                            its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy
                            through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharging fellow Pikachu with electric
                            shocks. </p>
            
                        <p>Pikachu has three alternate forms: the first one, Cosplay Pikachu, appeared exclusively in Pokémon Omega
                            Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. It is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and
                            can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five Contest conditions. The second form is
                            Pikachu in a cap, which debuted as an event-exclusive Pokémon in Generation VII. It is always male and
                            has eight variants, each wearing one of Ash's hats from the anime. In addition to these two forms, many
                            other Pikachu variants have appeared in various media. The last, Partner Pikachu is the Pokémon the
                            player starts with in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!. This Pikachu can be either gender, has higher base
                            stats, and has access to moves that normal Pikachu do not.</p>
            
                        <p>As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of
                            storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to
                            become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to
                            that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only
                            remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time</p>

                        <li>Pikachu was designed by Atsuko Nishida, a core designer at Game Freak.</li>
                        <li>The nation of Niue released a one-dollar coin with its coat of arms on one side and Pikachu
                            on the other to promote the Pokémon franchise.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu and its evolved form both share their category name with Sandshrew, Sandslash,
                            Rattata, Raticate, and Pawmi. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and
                            Raticate have also been called the Rat Pokémon.</li>
                        <li>Veronica Taylor has said Pikachu is her favorite Pokémon. Sarah Natochenny has as well,
                            shared with Mew.</li>
                        <li>In 2008, Japanese researchers discovered a new protein that helps carry electrical impulses
                            from the eyes to the brain and named it pikachurin. According to them, it was so named for
                            sharing Pikachu's "lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects".</li>
                        <li>Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has included three Pikachu balloons. "Flying Pikachu" was the
                            first, flown from 2001 to 2005, and was used in a morning rush hour test of wind conditions
                            in Times Square after an accident involving an M&M's balloon in the 2005 parade.It was last
                            used in the August 2006 Party of the Decade in New York City's Bryant Park. The second
                            balloon debuted in the 2006 parade, features glowing cheeks, and chases a Poké Ball balloon.
                            The third, introduced in the 2014 parade, wears a green scarf and holds a small,
                            Pikachu-shaped snowman.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu is the only core series starter Pokémon with a pre-evolved form, though Pokémon
                            Yellow predates Pichu and Pichu is unobtainable in Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!.
                        </li>
                        <li>According to A Sneak Peek at Pokémon, Pikachu can deliver a constant current of 1000
                            amperes.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu has the most event-exclusive moves available to it.</li>
                        <li>In the Japanese Pokémon Stadium, Pikachu is the only usable Pokémon that is not fully
                            evolved.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu is the only core series starter Pokémon that does not have a 7:1 gender ratio.</li>
                        <li>Black, White, Black 2, and White 2 are the only core series games in which Pikachu cannot be
                            obtained without transporting or an event.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu was the focus of a Pokémon Center collection in June 2014.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu is the only not fully evolved Pokémon whose base stats increased in Generation VI,
                            and also the only Pokémon to receive more than one stat increase: Defense and Special
                            Defense.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu is the only Pokémon that can be caught in all three pinball titles: Pokémon Pinball,
                            Pokémon Pinball mini, and Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu is number 025 in both the National Pokédex and Alola Pokédex in Sun and Moon.</li>
                        <li>Pikachu originally had a second-stage evolution named "Gorochu", which would have had two
