        Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Pikachu) is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.

        It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.

        In Alola, Pikachu will evolve into Alolan Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.

        Pikachu has a Gigantamax form. Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.

        In Pokémon Yellow, the starter Pikachu will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file. In Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!, the player's starter Pikachu also will not evolve, but cannot be traded to become a Raichu.

        Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the Pokémon franchise and one of Nintendo's major mascots.

        It is also the game mascot and starter Pokémon of Pokémon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu!. It has made numerous appearances on the boxes of spin-off titles.

        Pikachu is also the starter Pokémon in Pokémon Rumble Blast and Pokémon Rumble World.
